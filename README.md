## About This App

Feedbag is a react based food searching app. At present, it searches for recipes and restaurants from 2 different API's and returns them to the user based on search queries, and allows users to create and edit a grocery list. In future updates, Feedbag will allow users to favorite a restaurant or a recipe. It will then allow users to edit the recipes to their own specifications, based on their experimentation while creating those recipes. Additionally, Feedbag will allow users to make their own private notes on their favorites restaurants, so they can remember their favorite dishes or maybe that they had bad service, without alerting everyone and their mother to this face through an online review should they not want to do that.


## More Future Developments
In the future, Feedbag will include:
 - Social Media Authentication through Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram
 - A more customizable UserPage
 - Specific pages for Restaurants including Google Maps pins to show where it is
 - Specific pages for Recipes to show steps and ingredients, all of which will be editable by the user
 - Socia Media integration, allowing users to take pictures of their finished products and share them to social media
 - A private rating system for restaurants to allow users to know how they personally rate a restaurant
